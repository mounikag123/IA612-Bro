# IA612-Bro Project
The default clone will be from the working branch in order to keep things clean. I will merge the working branch into the master every sunday night before my report to backup all changes. 

## Git Commands:
- *git clone* https://github.com/MNFaust/IA612-Bro.git
- *git pull origin working* --> Every time you start to work on the project, make sure you're working on the lasted build with this command.
- *git add <your changes>*  --> Add any new documents, code, folders, etc.
- *git commit* --> Commits your changes and requests a comment from you to tell us of the changes
- *git push origin working*  --> Pushes all changes to the working branch
